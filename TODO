[O] serializer must do non-blocking reads!
[O] add "basic" testing (for do_square_int)
[O] currently the preprocessing doesn't work better with overriding:
    Example: "range K=1 P(K=1)=(a[K]->END)."
[O] with IF-THEN-ELSE constructs, optimize by translating only one branch, and not both
[O] fix memory leaks
[O] recursive sequential processes: const N=3 SEQ(I=1) = if (I<=N) then (act[I]-> SEQ(I+1);END) else END.
[O] aggregate labels and edges when printing with graphviz
