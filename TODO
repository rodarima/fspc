[O] in sequential composition, increase efficiency by starting the visit from the first node of the right side process, instead of the first node of the left side process
[O] save 'progresses' in the compiled file
[O] fix memory leaks
[O] put the functionality LOCATION_* into CircularBuffer
[O] when building a property, we must check that the process is deterministic
[O] build also a program 'ltsee', to see processes with graphviz
[O] add a '-t' option to see the the per process transitions, e.g. an expression of the process in the basic form.
[O] recursive sequential processes: const N=3 SEQ(I=1) = if (I<=N) then (act[I]-> SEQ(I+1);END) else END.
[O] implement one-line comments "//"
[O] aggregate labels and edges when printing with graphviz
[O] implement LTS animation
[O] fix alphabet propagation!! currently works only the final one..
